# Glorybook

A webpack plugin to use in conjunction with [@storybook/addons-docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/docs).  

Will take your contentful data and turn it into a markdown file that storybook can read.

## Install

```bash
npm i --save-dev glorybook
```

```bash
yarn add --dev glorybook
```

## Usage

The plugin will fetch data from the supplied contentful space, and output .mdx-files inside your webpack /src-folder.
By default the created files are put in a subfolder named `/contentful`.

*Be sure to not expose your space/access token in your public code*

**webpack.config.js**
```javascript
const GlorybookPlugin = require("glorybook");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new GlorybookPlugin({
      space: 'contentful space id', // required
      accessToken: 'contentful access token' // required
    })
  ]
}
```

## Example

This setup in your contentful content model:

Will output this in storybook:

With a file structure like this:
```
ðŸ“¦src
 â”— ðŸ“‚contentful
   â”— ðŸ“‚parent
     â”— ðŸ“‚child-folder
       â”— ðŸ“œnested-page.stories.mdx
```

**The plugin can currently handle**
- Rich text
- Images (single)
- Videos (single)
- Referenced content, including all of the above

## Dev-notes

The `/demo`-folder is used for previewing any test output during development of this plugin.  
This folder has a copy of storybook installed in order for us to run the plugin and have a real-world environment to sandbox in.  

For getting started with building on this project, run:
```bash
yarn inst
```
This will install all dependencies needed for both the plugin, and the demo environment.  

When any changes are made ...
```bash
yarn build
```
... will output files, applying the passed options specified in the `webpack.config.js`  

```bash
yarn demo
```
Can be run in order to build and startup the storybook inside `/demo`. This is currently used for testing. In a very WYSIWYG-fashion.
